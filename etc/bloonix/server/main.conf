#
# This parameter sets the desired maximum number of idle child processes.
# If equal or more than max_spare_servers processes are in idle state,
# then the excess processes will be killed.

# This parameter sets the absolute maximum number of child processes that
# can be forked.
#

#
# Default: /var/lib/bloonix/ipc/server.%P.lock
